# E-Commerce Backend API

## ðŸ“‹ Description
This project is a back-end e-commerce application that manages a product database using RESTful API principles. The application is built using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **MySQL2**, and **Sequelize ORM**. It supports CRUD operations for categories, products, and tags.

The API allows users to:
- Create, read, update, and delete categories.
- Manage products and their related categories.
- Manage tags and link them with products.
- Handle complex relationships with Sequelize models.

This project simulates a real-world e-commerce backend that businesses might use to manage their inventory.
